[INFO] Maven Plugin for EvoSuite 1.0.6
  Plugin used to run EvoSuite to automatically generate high coverage JUnit
  tests

This plugin has 7 goals:

evosuite:clean
  Remove all local files created by EvoSuite so far

evosuite:coverage
  Execute the manually written test suites (usually located under src/test/java)
  and return the coverage of each class.

evosuite:export
  When run, EvoSuite generate tests in a specific folder. New runs of EvoSuite
  can exploit the tests in such folder, and/or modify them.
  
  So, with 'export' we can copy all generated tests to a specific folder, which
  by default points to where Maven searches for tests. If another folder is
  rather used (or if we want to run with Maven the tests in the default EvoSuite
  folder), then Maven plugins like build-helper-maven-plugin are needed

evosuite:generate
  Generate JUnit tests

evosuite:help
  Display help information on evosuite-maven-plugin.
  Call mvn evosuite:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display parameter
  details.

evosuite:info
  Obtain info of generated tests so far

evosuite:prepare
  Mojo needed to prepare the EvoSuite tests for execution. This is needed to
  make sure that bytecode is properly instrumented.
